This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

# About me
I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics](https://biostat.duke.edu/) at Duke University, working under the guidance of Prof. [Anru Zhang](https://anruzhang.github.io/). I earned my Bachelor's degree in Statistics in 2019 from the University of Science and Technology of China and my Ph.D. in Statistics in 2024 from Florida State University, where I was supervised by Prof. [Hongyuan Cao](https://ani.stat.fsu.edu/~hycao/). My research interests encompass high-dimensional data analysis, causal inference, and machine learning.
