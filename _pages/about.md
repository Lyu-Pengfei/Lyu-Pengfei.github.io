Welcome to my homepate! I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics](https://biostat.duke.edu/) at [Duke University](https://duke.edu/), working under the guidance of Prof. [Anru Zhang](https://anruzhang.github.io/) and Prof. [Pixu Shi](https://github.com/Lyu-Pengfei). Before joining Duke, I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics in August 2024 from [Florida State University](https://www.fsu.edu/), where I was supervised by Prof. [Hongyuan Cao](https://ani.stat.fsu.edu/~hycao/). Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Statistics in 2019 from [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/)

# Research Interests
