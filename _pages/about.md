Welcome to my homepate! I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics](https://biostat.duke.edu/) at Duke University, working under the guidance of Prof. [Anru Zhang](https://anruzhang.github.io/) and Prof. [Pixu Shi](https://github.com/Lyu-Pengfei) . I earned my Bachelor's degree in Statistics in 2019 from the University of Science and Technology of China and my Ph.D. in Statistics in 2024 from Florida State University, where I was supervised by Prof. [Hongyuan Cao](https://ani.stat.fsu.edu/~hycao/). My research interests encompass high-dimensional data analysis, causal inference, and machine learning.
